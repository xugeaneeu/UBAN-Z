# Contributing Guide

## Branching Strategy

We use feature-based development.

Main branch is protected.

Branch naming:

- feature/<short-description>
- fix/<short-description>
- refactor/<short-description>
- chore/<short-description>

Examples:

- feature/booking-model
- feature/auth-jwt
- fix/booking-conflict

## Workflow

1. Create issue
2. Create branch from main
3. Implement feature
4. Open Pull Request
5. At least 1 approval required
6. CI must pass
7. Merge to main

Direct pushes to main are prohibited.
